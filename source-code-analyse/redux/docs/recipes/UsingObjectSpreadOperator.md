# Using Object Spread Operator

Since one of the core tenets of Redux is to never mutate state, you'll often find yourself using [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) to create copies of objects with new or updated values. For example, in the `todoApp` below `Object.assign()` is used to return a new `state` object with an updated `visibilityFilter` property:

```js
function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        visibilityFilter: action.filter
      })
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

While effective, using `Object.assign()` can quickly make simple reducers difficult to read given its rather verbose syntax.

An alternative approach is to use the [object spread syntax](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread) recently added to the JavaScript specification. It lets you use the spread (`...`) operator to copy enumerable properties from one object to another in a more succinct way. The object spread operator is conceptually similar to the ES6 [array spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator). We can simplify the `todoApp` example above by using the object spread syntax:

```js
function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:
      return { ...state, visibilityFilter: action.filter }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

The advantage of using the object spread syntax becomes more apparent when you're composing complex objects. Below `getAddedIds` maps an array of `id` values to an array of objects with values returned from `getProduct` and `getQuantity`.

```js
return getAddedIds(state.cart).map(id =>
  Object.assign({}, getProduct(state.products, id), {
    quantity: getQuantity(state.cart, id)
  })
)
```

Object spread lets us simplify the above `map` call to:

```js
return getAddedIds(state.cart).map(id => ({
  ...getProduct(state.products, id),
  quantity: getQuantity(state.cart, id)
}))
```

While the object spread syntax is a [Stage 4](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread#status-of-this-proposal) proposal for ECMAScript and accepted for the 2018 specification release, you will still need to use a transpiler such as [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) to use it in production systems. You should use the [`env`](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-env) preset, install [`@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread) and add it individually to the `plugins` array in your `.babelrc`.

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"],
  "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread"]
}
```
